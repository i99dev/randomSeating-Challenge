# API Challenge 42 Abu Dhabi ðŸŽ‡

> I don't submit this work, I just want to share it.

The Challenge: To build a smart solution that assigns, in a pseudo-random way, student seating for exams. The ideal solution will use the 42 Intranet API (https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc) to find the recent seats of the students and assign a seat other than their recent locations, while also taking into account things like piscine (cursus selection), lab choices, seating spacing, etc.

The Judging Criteria: The solution will be judged using the following:
â€¢	Relevance to the challenge topic
â€¢	Ingenuity / Creativity
â€¢	Ease of use
â€¢	Ease of deployment
â€¢	Ease of updating / maintaining
